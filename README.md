# Next_Generation_Political_System
This is an collaborative open source attempt to equip humans with an advanced way to shape the world in a way they would like to see it. In an open, peaceful, democratic way. Hence we believe this provides an evolution to current political systems

WHY does humanity need this?
Currenlty we see power hungry people in positions of political power. We believe that this is the wrong personality type of govern the planet. Current systems seem also rather inadequate to allow every human to have a say. 
We have
- rather autocratic political systems (Russia, Turkey)
- Systems that provide limited choices to who the people want in power (United States (Trump/Clinton)
- Systems where the will of people is not recognised but a decision is made via the court of law instead of counting the votes (United States (United States (Bush VS Gore)
- Systems that allow politicians to lawfully backstab their elected leaders and take over (Australia (Gillard/Rudd, Turnbull/Abott)
- Systems where politicians lawfully remove any form of alternative leaders to remain in power (Germany (Merkel))

All of the above have one thing in common - which is disregarding the will of the people.
It seems as if power hungry politicians manipulate and misuse the system for themselves instead of wanting the best for the people (bribes, gun-laws, genetical manipulated food, etc)

We believe that we humans can do better.
The technology is mature enough to replace the weaknesses of our current political system and re-focus to serve humanity.
And this is an attempt to align everything together to make this world a better place and help humanity evolve.
