# Next_Generation_Political_System
This is an collaborative open source attempt to equip humans with an advanced way to shape the world in a way they would like to see it. In an open, peaceful, democratic way. Hence we believe this provides an evolution to current political systems.

WHY does humanity need this?
Currenlty we see power hungry people in positions of political power. We believe that this is the wrong personality type of govern the planet. Current systems seem also rather inadequate to allow every human to have a say. 
We have
- rather autocratic political systems (Russia, Turkey)
- Systems that provide limited choices to who the people want in power (United States (Trump/Clinton)
- Systems where the will of people is not recognised but a decision is made via the court of law instead of counting the votes (United States (United States (Bush VS Gore)
- Systems that allow politicians to lawfully backstab their elected leaders and take over (Australia (Gillard/Rudd, Turnbull/Abott)
- Systems where politicians lawfully remove any form of alternative leaders to remain in power (Germany (Merkel))

All of the above have one thing in common - which is disregarding the will of the people.
It seems as if power hungry politicians manipulate and misuse the system for themselves instead of wanting the best for the people (bribes, gun-laws, genetical manipulated food, etc)

We believe that we humans can do better.
The technology is mature enough to replace the weaknesses of our current political system and re-focus to serve humanity.
And this is an attempt to align everything together to make this world a better place and help humanity evolve.

# People in Power & Governance
The only people in power should be the majority of people (aka voters). 
We only need a smaller group of people who administer and govern policies (council).
The personally type of those people should be educators, thinkers and helpers.

The council is elected directly by the people for 1 year.
The head of council (which is the head of state) is the head of state and is elected by the people for 1 year.
After 1 year the council and head of council/state are being re-elected directly by the people.

# Voting
People vote directly, in-person or via the internet.
People vote on policies, not parties.
Parties exists; a parties main purpose is to develop policies to respond to challenges or improve a situation.
A party's mission is to educate people on what they think the advantages and disadvantages of their policy is and what consequences and outcomes are expected by a policy.

# Polarisation & Conflict
To avoid polarisation and conflict there will always be at least 3 choices people can vote for on each topic/policy.

# Policies
Policies are categories in all major functions a state need to cover
- Education
- Immigration
- Internal Affairs (incl border control)
- Finances
- Environment
- Infrastructure (incl transportation)
- Foreign Affairs

# Next Steps
We need your help. We need to further develop and qualify and think through approaches. 
We need to focus on the system, not the content. The content is the job of the parties once this system is in place.
How do we get this system in place? We need to mature this system, then found a party and advocate and educate within existing political systems that this is the future, get an absolute majority and introduce this new system as the best way forward for humanity.
